This game is for my dog lovers, preferably pit bulls. In this game you will have to match all the adorable pitbulls together. Try not to cry over the cuteness. Good luck!
 
 

This game will start off with twelve different cards face down. They are pictures of pitbulls and you have to match them together by picking on two random cards. After you finish each round the cards will be shuffled.
